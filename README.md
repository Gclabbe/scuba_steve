# Scuba Steve Rapid Image Annotation
Smart Annotation Platform with Deep Learning

This is a preview of a project produced by Chris Labbe, Anjan Patnaik and Art Jiang as our Capstone in the FourthBrain.AI  
Machine Learning Engineering eductional program.

## Overview
### Problem
Computer Vision Training needs lots of annotated images
Annotation requires manual outlining or point selection 
Global labelling market ~$1.3B in 2020 w/ est. CAGR of 25.6%

### Solution Hypothesis
Use generalized region proposal models to outline objects
Human input to what that object is

### Test of Value
Time to generate meaningful annotated images
Mean Average Precision (mAP) when compared with SOTA models

## Goals
* Improve annotation speed
* Easy to use, interactive and flexible interface 
* Reasonable quality contours in lowest time
* Train and infer on new classes of objects
* Improve SOTA Instance segmentation models

## Benefits


## What makes this project different?


## The App


## Tech Stack
